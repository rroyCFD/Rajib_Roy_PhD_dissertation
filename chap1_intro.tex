\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

KE preservation is key for accurate prediction of time varying flow. 
Describe why it's crucial for LES

Briefly outline the role of discretization schemes, a better algorithm with better computational efficiency. 

ABL flow over complex terrain is of high Reynolds number. Wide range of scales. Accurate LES model can help to obtain better results.
