%% This document is part of the set of template files
%% for the uwyo_thesis style. This is your main file that
%% helps compile the entire document; each individual chapter
%% should be a separate file that is brought in using the
%% "\include{}" commands shown below.
%%
%% Step one: rename this file to something specific to you, such as
%% "Smith_thesis.tex" so your eventaul PDF file will end up having the
%% name "Smith_thesis.pdf."  You can also rename any individual chapter
%% files; if you do, be sure to make the appropriate change to the
%% "\include{}" commands below.
%%
%% Important: only *this* file should be compiled by LaTeX.
%% The individual chapter files are *not* standalone files.
%%
%% For interdisciplinary programs such as Neuroscience, see the
%% special section below

\begin{thesisabstract}
This is where you write your abstract.  Here are the guidelines on
the abstract according to UW and the
ProQuest/UMI organization (the company that archives theses and dissertations from
universities worldwide).


For a masters thesis, the abstract should ideally be around 60 to 80
words in length.  If you must, you can exceed this length, but the
abstract cannot exceed one page.  Any abstract text that exceeds
150 words will be truncated to the first 150 words (and any non-textual content will
be removed) by ProQuest for the online databases, although your full abstract will
be preserved in the complete electronic (PDF) version of your thesis.


For a Ph.D.\ dissertation, the abstract should ideally be no longer than 350 words. If
the abstract exceeds 350 words, it will be truncated to the first 350 words (and any
non-textual content will be removed) by ProQuest for the online databases, although your
full abstract will be preserved in the electronic (PDF) version of your dissertation. In
any case, the dissertation abstract cannot exceed two pages (one page is preferred).

\begin{thesisacknowledgments}
This is where you write any paragraphs you want to show up on the Acknowledgments page.
Traditionally, you use this space to thank your committee members for their help, any
funding sources such as an NSF grant that helped you, and so on.  This section is up to
you (no page or word limit, but exercise restraint) as long as it is written in a
professional manner. Be careful you don't end up with a messy page break, such as when
the automatic insertion of your name, the university name, and the month and date at the
end of this environment is the only thing that shows up on the next page.  Write more or
less text here to fix it!
